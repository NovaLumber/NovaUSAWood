        <h2>Ipe Hardwood Decking Is The Very Best Hardwood Available</h2>

        <p>Ipe hardwood decking has a rich dark brown color with beautiful grain characteristics. Also known as Brazilian Walnut, an Ipe hardwood deck will gradually age 
            to a lustrous silver-grey if left untreated. It can be oiled or stained to retain its rich brown color. Nova Ipe decking is available in sizes 1x4 through 2x12, 
            2x2 balusters, and 4x4 posts.<br />

        <h3>Rich Brown Color Requires Reapplication of Oil Finish</h3>
        
        <img alt="Ipe Hardwood Decking" title="Ipe Hardwood Decking" src="../images/products/Deck/Ipe/IpeDeckingSwatchMed.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="align-left" style="padding-right: 12px" /> 
        
        <p>Ipe hardwood decks will maintain their structural integrity as they age. To retain the rich brown color, we recommend a high quality penetrating oil finish with ultraviolet inhibitors. 
            Regular cleaning and reapplication of an oil finish will ensure that your Ipe hardwood decking retains its beauty for many years.</p>
