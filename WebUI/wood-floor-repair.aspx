    <h1>Wood Floor Repairs | Repairing Hardwood Flooring | Installation Tips</h1>
    <p>When repairing a hardwood floor, time and patience with the proper tools, techniques and products 
            will pay off in the end. It's very easy to damage pieces next to the ones that are being repaired, 
            and if damage occurs, it makes for a long day.</p>

            <h2>Site Finish Hardwood Flooring Repairs</h2>

            <p>For a 3/4" by 2 1/4" board, use a circular saw set at the proper depth (3/4 inch), making two passes 
            approximately 1/2" inch from each side of the board (not cutting past the end joints). The third cut 
            goes on an angle between the first two cuts, again not cutting through the side match. Once the cuts 
            are made, use a sharp chisel to remove the cut pieces. Clean and vacuum the groove and area around 
            the repair, making sure all debris is removed. After these steps are complete, select a straight 
            piece of flooring that has a similar grain pattern as the one removed. Cut the piece of flooring 
            to the exact length to ensure a tight fit, not leaving cracks at the end joints. (This repair can 
            also be done with a router and template.) Once the piece is cut to length, the bottom of the groove 
            will need to be removed. This can be done by scribing the back of the board with a razor knife, 
            then tapping the piece off with a hammer. Each end of the board can be beveled with a miter saw 
            or by using a block plane to bevel the groove-side of the board. Always dry fit the piece before 
            installing. Now the piece is ready to install, using a two- part epoxy. With a gun and nozzle, 
            apply the glue in the groove and on the tongue of the boards adjoining the repair. Also, apply 
            glue to the tongue and groove on the repair piece. The epoxy will set up very quickly, so time 
            is limited. The reason for using epoxy is that you can sand the repair within 10 to 15 minutes 
            after it is properly installed. Other glues will take longer to set and will require drying 
            overnight before the repair can be sanded.</p>

            <h2>Factory Finished Wood Floor Repairs | Prefinished, Engineered Wood Floor Repair</h2>

            <p>When repairing staple- or nail-down prefinished or job-site finished floors, the repair can 
            be done in the same manner. However, repairing a finished floor takes more time before and 
            during the repair to avoid damage to the already finished floor. Again, it is critical when 
            selecting boards on a prefinished floor repair to match grain, color, sheen and appearance 
            for best results. When repairing a floor that has been stained and finished, it takes a great 
            deal of experience, skill and patience to produce a successful repair. Using an edger and 
            fine-grit sandpaper (80-100 grit), sand the repair flat. After the repair is sanded, use 
            a sharp scraper IX inches wide to scrape scratches out and feather back into existing 
            stain or finish. I call this "chasing the grain." Using the natural pattern of the grain 
            in the wood flooring, lightly scrape and blend the area in which you are working. After 
            all scraping is complete, clean and hand sand with 80- or 100- grit paper. Do not sand 
            out into the finished area at this time. Then sand lightly around the repair with a 
            finer grit of sandpaper, mainly where the finish meets the bare wood. This will smooth 
            the finish so the stain doesn't bond to it and cause a darker halo.</p>

            <h2>Glued Down Wood Floor Repairs | Prefinished, Engineered Glue-Down Floor Repair</h2>

            <p>Repairing glue-down products takes a different approach. The adhesive used to glue 
            the flooring to the subfloor (whether wood or concrete) slightly glues one piece to 
            another, therefore making the repair difficult. However, the basic technique remains 
            the same. After making two cuts lengthwise and a third diagonally, the damaged 
            flooring should be removed with a chisel.</p>
