        <p>Jatoba or Brazilian Cherry Decking is rarely imported into the U.S. due to the high demand for Jatoba flooring and rough random width lumber. We recommend customers
        consider using Ipe Decking instead. Please contact us with any questions.</p>
        <p>Nova Ipe Decking has a rich dark brown color with beautiful grain characteristics. If left untreated, Ipe will gradually age to a lustrous silver-grey. 
        It can be oiled or stained to retain its rich brown color. Nova Ipe Decking is available in sizes 1x4 through 2x12, 2x2 balusters, and 4x4 posts. </p>
        <p>Nova Ipe decking is the strongest and most resilient natural untreated decking material available on the market today. An increasingly popular choice for
        both commercial and residential decking; it truly is the best decking product available in terms of strength, stability, durability, and natural resistance to
        decay, wet conditions, and infestation by termites and wood boreres of all types. Our Ipe contains no harmful chemicals and can be used near water with no worry
        of contamination.</p>
        <p>Nova Ipe Decking has a class A fire rating, the same rating given to concrete and steel. Nova Ipe Decking is an economical natural alternative to other decking
        options when the entire life cycle of the deck or outdoor project is considered. Its rich color and natural grain is breathtaking and is certain to provide a
        lifetime of beauty.</p>        
        <p>Nova Ipe Decking will maintain its structural integrity as it ages. To retain the rich brown color, we recommend a high quality penetrating oil finish with ultraviolet inhibitors. 
        Regular cleaning and reapplication of finish will ensure that the wood retains its beauty for many years.</p>
        <p>Nova Ipe is the finest decking material available. For low-maintanence, durability, and incredible beauty, choose a high quality natural material, and avoid the shortcomings of 
        composite and softwood decking.</p>
