            <p>We support the third party certification systems such as FSC, MGR and SFI as well as government certification systems.
            We are committed to sustainable 
            forestry and the legal sourcing of all our products.</p>
            <p>Tropical forests are an amazing resource and must be
            managed for long term sustainability in balance with the needs of local communities.</p>

            <p>Third party certification systems maintain the integrity of the hardwood supply chain, ensuring that the product delivered 
            is sourced from legal operations and is controlled by a system of oversight that not only monitors the 
            health of the forest but also the health of industry workers.</p>
            <p>Nova is in full compliance with the U.S. Lacey Act which requires that importers of hardwood products
            source their materials in accordance with the laws of the U.S. and the foreign producing country. 
            Our efforts include tracking all materials right back to the forest through certificates
            of origin and chain of custody documentation.</p>
