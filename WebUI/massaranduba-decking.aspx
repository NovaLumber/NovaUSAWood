        <p>Massaranduba Decking, also known as Brazilian Redwood Decking, has a rich red to brown coloring with a beautiful straight grain and
        a uniform, fine texture. If left untreated, Massaranduba 
        decking will become a silverish-gray. It can be oiled or stained to retain its distinctive red color. 
        Our decking is available in sizes 1x4 through 5/4x6, 2x2 balusters, and 4x4 posts. </p>

        It is often used for applications similar to Greenheart, and as it contains
        no harmful chemicals, it can be used near water without contamination concerns.</p>

        <p>Massaranduba Decking has a class A fire rating, which is the same rating given to steel or concrete. Massaranduba Decking 
        is an economical natural alternative to other decking
        options when the entire life cycle of the deck or outdoor project is considered, being 10 times stronger than most composite 
        decking products. Its rich red color and natural grain is striking and certain 
        to provide a lifetime of beauty.</p>
