    <h1>Experts in South American Supply</h1>
    <p>Nova Forest Products is based in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil with satellite procurement offices in Ji-Parana, 
    Rondonia, Manaus and Belem, Para state. We are experts in the export of Brazilian tropical wood products. The 
    Company is owned by David Zugman and John McGlocklin. They have 
    extensive experience in Brazilian lumber and procurement, so that we can knowledgeably offer any specie or 
    product being regularly produced anywhere in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Peru.</p>

    <p>We have our own concentration yard, warehouses, dry kilns and some remanufacturing capability. We operate 
    both as producer-exporters (specialized and small-scale) and as commissioned purchasing agents (essentially 
    as the Brazilian procurement office) for importers around the world.</p>

    <h2>Building Long Term Partnerships</h2>
    <p>At Nova, we work with many suppliers and customers based on long-term partnerships. We have very strong 
    relationships with our supply mills as we are able to provide them with a good mix orders of varied 
    specifications and species from the diverse markets that we work with, thus helping them to achieve good 
    yields from their logs and a diverse portfolio of orders, protecting them from the inevitable economic and 
    temporal downturns in one market or another. We have a solid support group and a systematic quality 
    control program.</p>

    <p>We can offer you volumes in S4S KD, S2S KD and AD, Rough Sawn KD, in a variety of species, such as: 
    Ipe -  Jatoba – Cumaru – Tauari – Goiabao – Sucupira - Red Cabreuva – Muiracatiara - Angelim Pedra – 
    Marupa, Massaranduba and others, Sliced Veneer 0.6mm and Slats 4mm.</p>

    <p>S4S and all other products needed by the Asian market are the main areas focus at this time. We 
    have in-house S4S production technicians who participate actively in setting up the production and 
    QC for the plants that we are working with. All of the production that we are selling comes from 
    mills with good quality machinery.</p>
    <h2>The Best Quality Control and Logistics</h2>
    <p>Conceptually, in the simplest of terms, our proposal is to act as your "eyes" in Brazil, finding 
    and establishing direct relationships between you and the appropriate producing mills. Your Company 
    will be the direct importer of record, paying the mills directly for the products that it buys. 
    Nova Forest Products takes responsibility for finding the mills, setting up the production, 
    overseeing grading/QC, shipping/vessel reservations, getting the material to the port and on a vessel, 
    supervision of emission of original export  documentation and confirmation of payment. If there are 
    problems/claims, Nova will also oversee their resolution in the best possible manner for all involved.</p>

    <p>Operationally, the procedure which works well for us and our core customers (and essentially the 
    procedure used by all who import regularly from Brazil) is as follows:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>We will let you know about the volumes/species we have available. Also, you can send us 
        inquiries with all necessary details for specifications, grades, species, finish, etc. for quoting, 
        at anytime.</li>
        <li>For your inquiries, Nova identifies the appropriate mills, and negotiates a price and ship 
        time which is provided to you;</li>
        <li>Your Company confirms (or doesn’t and gives feedback), then your Purchase Order or our 
        Pro-Forma Invoice will be issued in order to provide vendor information necessary for this 
        process and after it has been solidly confirmed, Nova produces a contract for the mill in 
        Portuguese with all the necessary details;</li>
        <li>Nova oversees the production and gives updates on status of said production;</li>
        <li>Nova oversees shipment of product and emission of original export/shipping docs;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proven Success</h2>    
    <p>This program has proven highly successful for Nova's trading partners in many product areas. In 
    essence, Nova offers you an efficient and safe/controlled way to develop business directly with 
    Brazilian suppliers.</p>
