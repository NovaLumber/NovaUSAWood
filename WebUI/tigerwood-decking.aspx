        <h2>Distinctive, Original, and Beautiful: Tigerwood Hardwood Decking</h2>
        <p>Tigerwood decking, also known as <em>Goncalo Alves</em>, is one of the most distinctive natural decking materials in the world. There are other woods bearing 
        animal-associated names, such as Para Rosewood's alternate moniker "Monkeywood." Unfortunately for Monkeywood, there are not many naturally ruby-red monkeys 
        in the world. </p>
        <p>However, Tigerwood (sometimes also known as <em>Bois de Zebre</em>, or "Zebrawood", in French) bears a beautifully striking resemblance to its namesake: 
        The background of Tigerwood hardwood decking is a light yellow-orange to more distinct orange with a fine texture and a medium luster. Set over this is the 
        distinctive bold black striping that completes the gorgeously exotic tiger-look of Tigerwood decking.</p>

        <h2>The Tigerwood Tree and Environmental Sustainability: The Origins of Our Tigerwood Hardwood Decking, Responsible Harvesting Practices, and FSC Certified Formats</h2>
        <p>Tigerwood can be found in many places and climates throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean and at a range of altitudes, predominantly in Neotropical 
        forests. The tree itself can reach up to 3 feet in diameter, and reach heights of up to 120ft. Freshly cut, the Tigerwood log reveals brilliant orange tones with bold black 
        striping.</p>
        <p>Like all Nova wood products, we take special pride and care in ensuring that our Tigerwood Decking is manufactured and harvested in environmentally sustainable ways. 
        We proudly offer <em>FSC certified Tigerwood Decking</em> products in addition to our other responsibly harvested formats.</p> 

        <h2>Ferociously Resistant: Tigerwood Decks are Very Durable and Features a Substantial Janka Hardness Rating</h2>
        <p>A Tigerwood deck will age well. In a similar fashion to Ipe decking, it will slowly undergo a color shift if left untreated and attain a distinguished silvery-gray 
        shade over time. Tigerwood decks feature great resistance to rot and decay, with particular resistances to insects and fungus.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Tigerwood decks do not require unsafe chemicals in order to protect the wood from wear and tear. A <em>Tigerwood Deck Janka hardness rating</em> comes 
        in at 1,850 pounds. Compared to many softwood decking products, <em>Tigerwood hardness</em> is vastly superior. A <em>Western Red Cedar Deck Janka hardness rating</em> 
        is 340 pounds, with Tigerwood being over 5 times as hard.</p>
        	
        <h2>Easy to Install with A Variety of Tigerwood Deck Formats to Suit Any Project: 1x4, 5/4x4, and 5/4x6</h2>

        decking is also rated as easy to <em>screw and nail</em>, requiring less effort and strain for a successful installation.</p>
