        <h2>Batu Hardwood Decking – The Natural Choice For Value and Quality.</h2>
        <p>Fine landscape architecture demands the highest quality materials.  Professional builders and do-it-yourselfers alike enjoy working with Nova's Batu hardwood decking because of its high quality and remarkable consistency.</p>
        <p>Nova Batu hardwood decking closely resembles the rich classic look of Mahogany. Heartwood from Batu hardwood ranges from a medium red to a deep red / brown with purple tinges and often has resin canals with white contents in concentric lines on end surfaces which produce a warm and visually striking effect.  The texture is moderately fine and grain is typically interlocked.</p>

        <p>Our Batu Decking offers a complete package for all your outdoor projects and is available in 1x4, 1x6, 5/4x4, 5/4x6, 2x4, 2x6 and 4x4 sizes plus handrail, balusters, T&amp;G porch flooring and trim boards from 1x8 through to 2x12.  
        With a rich natural beauty and legendary hardiness that is not easily found in other decking materials, Batu Decking is the natural answer for exterior decking applications.</p>

        <h3>Meranti Batu Hardwood Decks - Quality Without Compromise</h3>
        <img alt="Meranti Batu Decking Stack" title="Meranti Batu Decking Stack" src="/images/products/Deck/Meranti/meranti-decking-stack2.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="align-left" style="padding-right: 12px" />
        <p>Batu (also known as Red Selangan Batu, Red Balau, Membatu, Meranti Batu, Mangaris) is known for its hardness, beauty and natural durability.</p>
        <p>While there are more than 200 different species of Meranti / Philippine Mahogany found throughout Asia, Batu Hardwood Decking utilizes only a select few species found within the Shorea Genus. Adding to the product's appeal is the fact that our Batu is carefully graded in order to achieve a nearly blemish-free decking with excellent colour consistency plus superior strength and natural durability.</p>
        <p>Because we stake our reputation on the superior quality of our products we are confident that when your project is complete, no other material will provide you with the satisfaction and distinctive beauty of Batu hardwood decking.</p>

        <h2>Meranti Batu Hardwood - Strong, Naturally Beautiful and Stable.</h2>
        <p>Meranti Batu hardwood is the first choice for any job that requires a superior finish, natural durability and long lasting performance. Batu is a versatile, distinctive wood
        which lends elegance to any project. While many people are partial to the rich, classic look of a Mahogany deck, most don’t like the inconsistency or the maintenance hassles that 
        accompany products like Cambara or Meranti. The Nova Batu product line is therefore ideal - providing customers long-lasting durability and visual appeal from their Batu decks 
        with minimal maintenance efforts.</p>

        <p>Batu hardwood decking is available in lengths up to 20' and comes both yard-packed and pulled-to-length. Like other Nova hardwood decking products, 
        Batu is easily installed with traditional face fastening techniques or hidden fastener systems such as the Eb-Ty EBE004 or Tiger Claw TC-4S. 
        Pre-grooved Batu is also available by request.</p>

        <h3>Only Environmentally Sustainable Red Balau / Batu, Every Time.</h3>
        <p>Batu decking comes from tropical hardwood forests in Indonesia which are essentially public lands, managed and protected by the Government of Indonesia. Natural forest utilization in Indonesia was started in the 1970s as a national development program.</p>
        <p>Indonesia has designated all forest lands according to four classifications in order to ensure a sustainable balance between preservation and development. They have been named: production forests, conversion forests, protection forests, and conservation forests or national parks and wildlife refuges. About 113 million hectares have thus been set aside as permanent forests (for the production, protection and conservation groupings).</p>
        <p>Two forest certification systems are in use at present in Indonesia: the Indonesian ecolabelling system developed by LEI (Lembaga Ekolabel Indonesia); and the Forest Stewardship Council scheme. Although the LEI and FSC certification systems were originally developed quite separately, the two organizations have been working to bring them closer together over the past ten years. LEI and the FSC signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 1999, and strengthened this working agreement with a Joint Certification Protocol on September 20, 2000.</p>
        <p>Nova and our affiliates have an ongoing commitment to the preservation and responsible utilization and management of our forest resources. We strongly encourage all of our Batu suppliers to follow best industry practices in order to minimize damage to the environment and ensure long term sustainability. Every piece of lumber purchased or sold by us is in compliance with all local, national and international laws and regulations.</p>
