        <h2>Superior Kiln Sticks for Superior Kiln Drying</h2>
        <p>Our kiln sticks, also known as stacking sticks or kiln stickers, are made of the highest quality exotic lumber. Our sticks include naturally durable tropical hardwood species like:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Purpleheart</li>
        <li>Cumaru</li>
        <li>Massaranduba</li>
        <li>Ipe</li>
        <li>Angelim Pedra</li>
        <li>Tatajuba</li>
        <li>Plantation Grown Eucalyptus</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Hardwood Kilns Sticks will Always Outlast Softwood Sticks</h3>

        <p>These kiln sticks are far harder than domestic species with very high density. These qualities ensure that our kiln sticks will stay straight, resist decay, and remain durable even after multiple charges at high temperatures.</p>

        <h2>Stacking Lumber Perfectly is the Key to Quality Kiln Drying</h2>
    
        <img alt="Kiln Sticks" src="../images/scenes/kiln-sticks/stacked-lumber-palm-trees.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="align-left" style="padding-right: 12px" />
        <p>Stacking lumber properly with good quality kiln sticks is a necessity for producing evenly kiln dried wood. Additionally, good sticks increase the stability of lumber stacks. Inferior stacking sticks can produce undesirable effects such as sticker shadow or sticker stain. Our top quality kiln sticks will never produce these shadows or stains.</p>
        <h3>High Grade Kiln Sticks in a Variety of Sizes to Suit All Your Kiln Drying Needs</h3>
        <p>Our kiln sticks come in the following sizes: </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
        <li>3/4" x 1-1/2" x 96"</li>
        <li>3/4" x 1-1/4" x 96"</li>
        <li>3/4" x 1-1/2" x 72"</li>
        <li>3/4" x 1-1/2" x 54"</li>
        <li>3/4" x 1-1/2" x 48"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our kiln stickers are held to the highest standards to guarantee durability, moisture content, and uniformity in order to promote the stability and even drying of your lumber. All our kiln sticks are select and better grade.</p>
